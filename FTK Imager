Ex. No 1: Evidence Acquisition Using AccessData FTK Imager  

Description  
Forensic Toolkit (FTK) is a computer forensics software product made by AccessData.  
This is a Windows-based commercial product. For forensic investigations, the same development team has created a **free version** with fewer functionalities.  

The FTK Imager tool is capable of both acquiring and analyzing computer forensic evidence.  

The evidence FTK Imager can acquire can be split into two main parts:  
1. Acquiring volatile memory  
2. Acquiring non-volatile memory (Hard disk)  

**Two possible ways this tool can be used in forensic image acquisitions:**  
- Using FTK Imager portable version in a USB pen drive or HDD and opening it directly from the evidence machine (commonly used in live data acquisition).  
- Installing FTK Imager on the investigator’s laptop. In this case, the source disk should be mounted into the investigator’s laptop via **write blocker**.  
 - The write blocker prevents data modification on the source disk and provides read-only access, ensuring integrity.  


Acquiring Volatile Memory Using FTK Imager  

FTK Imager allows investigators to collect the complete volatile memory (RAM) of a computer.  

Steps: 
1. Open FTK Imager and navigate to the volatile memory icon (Capture Memory).  
2. Options available:  
   - Pagefile: `pagefile.sys` in Windows is used when RAM is exceeded, and may contain valuable data. Recommended to capture.  
   - AD1 file: FTK Imager image file format, allows evidence storage for later use.  
3. Clicking the Capture Memory button starts acquiring volatile memory.  

> Note: Once acquisition completes, the destination folder will have the acquired memory with the extension `.mem`.  

Acquiring Non-Volatile Memory (Disk Image) Using FTK Imager  

This tool can also be used to collect a disk image.  

Steps:
1. Open FTK Imager → Navigate to **Create Disk Image.  
2. Select the source to acquire.  
   - FTK Imager can acquire physical drives, logical drives (partitions), image files, folders, or CDs/DVDs.  
   - For external HDDs, connect via a write blocker and use the Logical Drive option.  
3. Select Physical Drive → Choose the drive → Click Finish.  

Supported Disk Image Formats: 
- Raw (dd): Most common, contains no metadata, simple bitstream.  
- SMART: Linux-based format with compression and headers.  
- E01: Proprietary EnCase format. Includes case info, MD5 hash, examiner details, notes, etc.  
- AFF (AFF4): Open forensic format, prevents vendor lock-in.  

4. Enter case details (examiner’s name, notes, etc.).  
5. Add image destination, file name, and fragment size.  
   - Image Fragment Size (MB): Splits into multiple files. Set to `0` to save as one file.  
6. Select Verify images after creation → ensures hash integrity but increases acquisition time.  
7. Click Start → Acquisition begins.  

> Note: Once acquisition completes, a **text file** is created with all acquisition details. Hash values are matched for integrity verification.

Result  
Successfully acquired volatile memory and non-volatile disk image using AccessData FTK Imager, ensuring forensic integrity.
