## 📂 Experiments Included

### 1. Evidence Acquisition using FTK Imager
- **Aim:** To acquire volatile and non-volatile memory using FTK Imager.  
- **Tools Used:** FTK Imager, Computer System, Sample Evidence Data.  
- **Description:** FTK Imager is a forensic imaging tool used to capture memory (RAM) and disk images while maintaining data integrity. The tool supports formats such as `RAW`, `SMART`, `E01`, and `AFF`. Investigators can use it in live or offline acquisition scenarios with write blockers to prevent evidence tampering.
